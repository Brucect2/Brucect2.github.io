I am a second-year Ph.D student in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). My research interests lie in computational imaging, computer graphics and computer vision. Currently I am working with Professor [Ioannis Gkioulekas](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~igkioule/) on inverse rendering especially for sub-surface scattering material. Before that, I obtained my Master's degree in [Biomedical Engineering](https://www.cmu.edu/bme/) at CMU, focusing on medical image analysis, advised by Professor [John Galeotti](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/john-galeotti/). Before I came to CMU, I completed my undergraduate study in [Biomedical Engineering](http://www.bme.uconn.edu/) at [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/), where I worked on bio-imaging and bioinstrumentation with Professor [Guoan Zheng](https://sites.google.com/site/gazheng/people), Professor [Quing Zhu](https://engineering.wustl.edu/Profiles/Pages/Quing-Zhu.aspx) and Professor [John Enderle](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=H73vy_sAAAAJ&hl=en).

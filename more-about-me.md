My Chinese name is 车成千, I am from the "Spring City" Jinan, the capital of Shandong province in Eastern China. I moved to the U.S. in 2010 via a student exchange program. After one year's of study in [Ledyard High School](http://lhs.ledyard.net/) in Connecticut, I decided to pursue higher education in the U.S. 

Besides research, I served as a teaching assistant in the following courses:
* **Uconn**
    * fs
* **CMU**

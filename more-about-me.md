My Chinese name is 车成千, I am from the "Spring City" Jinan, the capital of Shandong province in Eastern China. I moved to the U.S. in 2010 via a student exchange program. After one year's of study in [Ledyard High School](http://lhs.ledyard.net/) in Connecticut, I decided to pursue higher education in the U.S. 

At UConn I really enjoyed working as an Audio/Visual technician in the Student Union to provide technological support for meetings and events within the Student Union. This includes projectors, laptops, microphones, lighting and sound mixing equipment. test..

Besides research, I served as a teaching assistant in the following courses:
